# MyRuns
MyRuns is an app created to track user fitness data, whether it be the user tracking it themselves, or the app using geolocation to automatically track exercises.
Here you will find the different versions of MyRuns. MyRuns 1 was just the basic app with a Sign In page and Profile Creation step. MyRuns 2 shows the home page with Tab View Layout. Myruns 3 integrates a SQL database into Myruns and stores user-stored exercises. MyRuns 4 uses asynchronous tasks to retrieve data from the database and display it as well as Services to track location automatically. Enjoy!
